# Code of Conduct

To qualify to join this ring, you need to have a site featuring table-top rpg content that includes random tables, in either analog or digital form on your website. This is *incredibly* loose; I don't care if the random tables are infrequent, from your tables phase in 2009, or inside a pwyw book on itch.io.

You also need to include the "next" and "previous" buttons provided on the main page, at the bare minimum, on your site (ie, keep it a ring!). Styling, attribution, and associated text and images are entirely up to you. Please place the linking code in a visible, easy to find spot (for example, mine's next to my blog's search widget).

# Rules:

1. This is a ring hosted by me, Tam H., out of my github. I am not interested in policing content for age, maturity, or tone. I am not the internet police, nor am I your mother. I do not need any more stress in my life. I will not be going over anything with a fine-toothed comb. That said...
   
2. **Hateful ideologies are not welcome.** This includes abuse, harassment, frivolous and false accusations, and discrimination, particularly on the basis of race, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression, or physical or mental ability. Just don't sign up if you think you're in this bucket or this offends you. Make your own ring if you want; it's <a href="https://webringdemo.netlify.app/">easy</a>.
   
3. I reserve the right to remove anything I need to whenever I please or get around to it in order to keep things tidy, to keep up with the purpose of this ring, and to uphold rules 1 and 2. You have the right to leave this ring at any time without fuss; just delete the code from your site and let me know via the form or in the repo (or wait and when I notice I'll fix it).
